# Tic Tac Toe

## Description

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players, X and O, take turns to mark the cells. The objective is to get three of your marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The game detects winning conditions and announces the winner, or declares a draw if all cells are filled without a winner. Players can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on any cell in the 3x3 grid to place your mark (X or O).
3. Players take turns until one player gets three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) or all cells are filled (resulting in a draw).
4. When a player wins or a draw occurs, an alert will be displayed, and the game will reset for a new round.
5. To manually restart the game, click the "Restart" button.
